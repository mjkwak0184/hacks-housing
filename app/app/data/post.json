The move in date would be August 15th (It could be 2-3 days earlier, but we’re trying to get everything from the room moved out, cleaned, and sanitized). The place is located in North Berkeley and it’s about a 5-10 minute walk from campus.\nI prefer things to be organized & clean, and I’m hoping for roommates who are the same! When it comes to chores and such, it’s preferred that each person washes their dishes after eating to avoid pile up. Other things such as sweeping/mopping/taking out trash, we could do on a weekly rotation as I’ve done with past roommates! You’d have to be okay with living with a cat as well, because there is one in the apartment! If you’re interested, please reach out and we can text and Facetime to see if we’re a good fit: 702-788-5959!",

    "body": "Hello Cal Students! PLEASE READ ENTIRE POST! (AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY)\nDescription:\nI am a 4th year Cal student looking for people (LGTBQ+/Queer/BIPOC friendly!) to share my apartment for the upcoming semester with no definitive end date. It is a 2bd/1bth located in Downtown Berkeley and you will be getting your own private room . We are a 15 min walk from campus and are close to all student amenities (Trader Joe's, Park, BART, etc.). There is a laundry room in the building and street parking is usually available. Rent for the single room will be 1140$ + utilities. The preferred move in date is November 1st but if you are coming in for the Spring Semester we can discuss that.\nHousemate Qualities:\nAs someone who has been living with other students/professional adults for the last several years of my life, I have come across the best and the worst of housemate qualities and/or practices. These are some of the qualities I am looking for in a potential housemate (but are by no means a hard requirement):\nClean, Respectful, Compromising, Kind, Self and Situationally Aware\nQueer, BIPOC, or LGBTQ+ (or someone that is amiable towards different gender, sex, race, or creed)\n420/Nicotine/Alc friendly (this is a pretty big one for me)\nNeurodivergent (I am extremely friendly towards people with intellectual disabilities whatever that may mean)\nNight-Person Friendly (I usually stay up late so this is important if that is something that will bother you)\nBlunt and Honest Communicator (this is perhaps the most important one on the list)\nAbout Me:\nMy name is George (he/him)! I am going to be beginning my 4th year at Cal in the Spring Semester. My hobbies include PC gaming (mainly LoL), skateboarding, intellectual discussion, and cooking! I am a pretty quiet person and am usually extremely reserved. I have great communication skills and am usually extremely honest/blunt. I usually become friends with people who are able to be both cynical and hopeful, have good listening and communication skills, and are able to look past themselves and compromise for the sake of others (a value that I will most certainly give back to you!).\nI am more than happy to communicate with people about their needs and their plans so if this seems like a good fit for you please feel free to shoot me a DM and I am sending out the best of luck in your housing search adventure!",

    "body": "Hello Cal Students! PLEASE READ ENTIRE POST! (AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY)\nDescription:\nI am a 4th year Cal student looking for people (LGTBQ+/Queer/BIPOC friendly!) to share my apartment for the upcoming semester with no definitive end date. It is a 2bd/1bth located in Downtown Berkeley and you will be getting your own private room . We are a 15 min walk from campus and are close to all student amenities (Trader Joe's, Park, BART, etc.). There is a laundry room in the building and street parking is usually available. Rent for the single room will be 1140$ + utilities. The preferred move in date is November 1st but if you are coming in for the Spring Semester we can discuss that.\nHousemate Qualities:\nAs someone who has been living with other students/professional adults for the last several years of my life, I have come across the best and the worst of housemate qualities and/or practices. These are some of the qualities I am looking for in a potential housemate (but are by no means a hard requirement):\n- Clean, Respectful, Compromising, Kind, Self and Situationally Aware\n- Queer, BIPOC, or LGBTQ+ (or someone that is amiable towards different gender, sex, race, or creed)\n- 420/Nicotine/Alc friendly (this is a pretty big one for me)\n- Neurodivergent (I am extremely friendly towards people with intellectual disabilities whatever that may mean)\n- Night-Person Friendly (I usually stay up late so this is important if that is something that will bother you)\n- Blunt and Honest Communicator (this is perhaps the most important one on the list)\nAbout Me:\nMy name is George (he/him)! I am going to be beginning my 4th year at Cal in the Spring Semester. My hobbies include PC gaming (mainly LoL), skateboarding, intellectual discussion, and cooking! I am a pretty quiet person and am usually extremely reserved. I have great communication skills and am usually extremely honest/blunt. I usually become friends with people who are able to be both cynical and hopeful, have good listening and communication skills, and are able to look past themselves and compromise for the sake of others (a value that I will most certainly give back to you!).\nI am more than happy to communicate with people about their needs and their plans so if this seems like a good fit for you please feel free to shoot me a DM and I am sending out the best of luck in your housing search adventure!",

I'm currently pursuing my studies abroad and in search of a room, preferably a single, for sublease or rent during the spring semester. I'm hoping to find a place that's close to campus, within walking distance. It would be ideal if the rent or monthly payment included utilities, and having a laundry unit within the apartment would be a plus. I'm a neat and easygoing individual, and I'd love to find housemates who value cleanliness and a peaceful environment. My budget for accommodation falls within the range of $879 to $989.

Washer and dryer in the building, and the location is really convenient!\n\nAbout me:\nI am from South Korea, and I am currently a junior at Berkeley. My pronouns are she/her.\nYou will be living with my pup as well, so I am looking for someone who is pet friendly!
